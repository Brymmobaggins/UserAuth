// Here are some basic features you could add to enhance your project:

### 1. **Password Strength Indicator**
   - Add a visual indicator to show the strength of the password (e.g., weak, medium, strong) as the user types.
   - This can help users create stronger passwords.

### 2. **Remember Me Option**
   - Add a "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page.
   - If checked, store the user's session in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to keep them logged in.

### 3. **Logout Functionality**
   - Add a logout button that clears the user's session and redirects them to the login page.

### 4. **Profile Page**
   - Create a profile page where users can view and update their details (e.g., email, security question, etc.).
   - Ensure sensitive fields like passwords are updated securely.

### 5. **Forgot Username**
   - Add a feature to retrieve the username using the email and security question.

### 6. **Validation Enhancements**
   - Add client-side validation for all fields (e.g., email format, password length, etc.).
   - Provide real-time feedback for invalid inputs.

### 7. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - Add a toggle button to switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.

### 8. **Account Deletion**
   - Allow users to delete their accounts after confirming their password.

### 9. **Rate Limiting for Login Attempts**
   - Implement a mechanism to limit login attempts (e.g., lock the account for 5 minutes after 3 failed attempts).

### 10. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Add an optional 2FA feature using email or a one-time password (OTP).

### 11. **Email Verification**
   - Simulate email verification by requiring users to confirm their email before logging in.

### 12. **User Activity Logs**
   - Track and display user activity, such as the last login time or failed login attempts.

### 13. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the UI is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.

### 14. **Password Visibility Toggle**
   - Add a toggle button to show or hide the password in the input field.

### 15. **Custom Error Pages**
   - Create custom error pages (e.g., 404 or 500) for better user experience.
